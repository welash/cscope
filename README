BUILDING:
Try:

./configure
make

TIPS:
- Try to use flex as the lexical analyzer. There may be some problems with using the native lex (due to some problems). The has been reported as a problem on Solaris.
- On Linux systems (and possibly others) configure may fail if lex is a synomyn for flex. To fix, do the following:

	make distclean
	./configure --with-flex
	make
